# AI-Eye-Detection

Summarizes:
Create an AI model that through 6 eye photos creates a virtual eye with the information of the
6 original eyes. The 6 photos are 3 photos with left flash and 3 photos with right flash. You
have to cut into 2 circles, 1 outer circle eliminating the white part and 1 inner circle.
Requirements:
Cut out the eyes creating the exact size as the final result.
Get the information out of the eyes and create the final result, without the flash.
Add some contrast so that the result is perfect.
Create the outline effect around it, creating a copy.
